It's just over 2 years since I was diagnosed with #anxiety and #depression. Today I'm taking a moment to reflect on how far I've come since.
"It's Sunday, I need a break, so I'm planning to spend as little time as possible on the #A14..."
Awake but tired. I need to sleep but my brain has other ideas...
RT @SewHQ: #Retro bears make perfect gifts and are great for beginners too! Get stitching with October's Sew on sale NOW! #yay http://t.co/…
It’s hard to say whether packing lists are making life easier or just reinforcing how much still needs doing... #movinghouse #anxiety
Making packing lists is my new hobby... #movinghouse
At what point does keeping stuff for nostalgic reasons cross the line into plain old hoarding...? #movinghouse
Currently in the finding-boxes-of-random-shit packing phase. I think I’m a closet hoarder...
"Can't be bothered to cook, take away on the way 😁👍🏼 #lazy"
RT @itventsnews: ITV releases promo video for the final series of Downton Abbey http://t.co/mC8Ive72zR http://t.co/CFBKrRvJIs
"... also, I have too much stuff. Way, way too much #movinghouse"
I never want to put one of these together again #lotharderthanitlooks http://t.co/70ujlTCKlB
Moving stuff is bloomin’ knackering... and there’s still loads to do... 😥
"Back at the house, moving stuff. It’s so peaceful here... I ❤️ 🏡 😊"
Urgh. Anxiety. FFS where does it come from?! (Breathe...)
"I have too much stuff. Way, way too much... Massive purge on the way."
Hideous traffic on the A14. Must remember to pay closer attention to the traffic reports...
Packing and purging. Feels good 😊👍🏼
In B&amp;Q looking at internal doors. Fun times 😉
"Time to get up. So many things to do, such a busy day ahead..."
It's 6:20... do I get up or lie here a little longer with my cat buddy... ❓
There's nothing like cocktails and exhaustion to aid a good night's  sleep...
Great night out with my favourite ladies. Much needed after the past few days. I love them so much 💕
Sat down on the sofa for a quick rest... an hour ago. Need to move.
How much do I want pizza right now...?
"I will always love you.

Peter Gabriel - In Your Eyes http://t.co/foAexmvoid"
Such a busy day ahead. I need to focus but I'm feeling on the edge of derailment right now.
Even now the smallest thing still makes my heart break. I doesn't feel like that ever goes away.
"Why is choosing a curtain pole suddenly so confusing? Too. Many. Choices. And yes, I know this isn't a 'real' problem."
Completed on my house. Got the keys. What a fab day! Whoop! 🏡🎉💕
"RT @CPHighWycombe: @CatsProtection Hi - could you retweet our long stayers, Sammy and Suki? Photographed them today...buckscats.org.uk http…"

I feel like an invisible hand is trying to remove both my eyeballs with a spoon 😖
RT @designtaxi: ‘Hair tapestry’ is the latest hair trend http://t.co/nEqzTNqVjJ http://t.co/WrjBKlcVvo

"@ThomasEvansUKIP it's The Mail, it's entirely their MO. Mail Online is barely 'news' 😕"
@OffensiveBanter it's so awful 😟
The awfulness of it continues. Heartbreaking 😟 https://t.co/wdZELWA3ah
Lazy afternoon snooze with my kitty cat... #lazysunday
The pain and heartbreak of tragedy is such a confusing emotion. I feel such sadness for my south coast friends #shoreham
Pouring with rain in #cambridge. That sun didn't last long... 😕

Toaster shopping is needlessly confusing...
"Finding it hard to find a 'funky' decent quality toaster at a reasonable price. All silver, boring or cheap looking... #firstworldproblems"
RT @BBCSussex: This very sad footage has been released of the #Shoreham air crash. The content is obviously distressing. http://t.co/aG2sWz…
@Sarah_Booker I had the same thought 😟

This is the last time I'm going to take this bus to work. Feels weird.
... I need to care less but don't want to have a hard heart 😕
I don't know why I allow myself to feel such disappointment in someone even after all this time...
Last day in the office for 2 weeks. Whoop! 😊
Horrible muggy weather #cambridge #weather

@MurderKube thank you so much &lt;3
this is surreal
"If anyone needs advice, insight or just someone to talk to, please don't hesitate to ask me, I'll always be happy to help!"
and to those of you that think you haven't done much; small amounts of support in large quantities still makes a big difference
"Once again thank you to everyone, I would literally not be here without you"
to say that I'm very happy is a severe understatement
every single person I talked to at that place was so nice and understanding and perfect
and all of this isn't going to cost me anything
I have a safe place to go and talk with other LGBT people every day if I need/want
I met 2 great people while I was there who are exceptionally helpful and understanding
"I have healthcare now, I have an endo appointment in february and I start transitioning in march"
heres the big news
so today couldn't have gone better
here we go
@MurderKube Im gonna make her tell me tonight
"this appointment went superbly, now just one more place to go to"
@SS_Mangos of course
@MurderKube OMFG
@WillsShadow apparently
MY PARENTS ARE LITERALLY WEEBS AND THEYVE BEEN HIDING THEIR POWERLEVEL ALL THIS TIME HOW DID I NOT NOTICE
IM LIKE MOM YOU REALISE WHO YOU JUST DREW? AND SHE LIKE YEAH ONE OF THOSE BOATGIRLS
AND SHE DRAWS FUCKING SHIMAKAZE'S OUTFIT http://t.co/bqx80WSdvY
I ask her what her fav outfit was and she says she doesn't know the name of the girl but she can draw it
"then I ask how she knew about cosplay and she says ""I really like anime girl outfits and I used to cosplay myself"""
she says 2 weeks AND THAT SHE'LL DO IT FOR FREE
so we talk out all the details and she says she'll even make me her thighhigh boots and glasses and then I ask how long it'll take her
then she pulls up a paper and starts drawing her outfit and asking me all these questions about it http://t.co/MKzm0xkysb
at that point I started freaking out like she actually knows homura and all the megukas
"now I ask if she'd make me a cosplay of homura and she says ""is that the emo girl from the madoka anime?"""
turns out my mom is a total weeb
she took out her iPad and showed me a collection of manga and anime and Love Live of all things
"I asked if she knew what cosplaying was and she said yes, then I asked if she was familiar with anime and she got really offended"
already was pretty happy about that but I decided to test her promise and her sewing skills
at the end of the talk she says she fully accepts who I am and will support me in any way possible and a year before she kicked me out
its late night and she starts asking me about a bunch of trans stuff and I just answer her honestly
the reason I was supposed to go see my mom was she wanted to talk to me about something face to face
I was already in awe over that but the day got even better
I asked him about it and he said hes really into 90s anime and jp culture
"turns out my dad has a whole collection of doujins under his bed, mostly from the 90s"
as I walk into my dads bedroom to get my clothes I turn to look at him and he's literally reading a doujin
so I'm about to leave to my moms house but I realised I'd probably stay there for 2 nights instead of one so I decided to get extra clothes
this is the same story I tried to tell last week but I didn't because I was feeling horrible
I have to wait until 14 for my appointment so story time
"heading to the trans clinic now, hopefully I'll bring back some good news"

I am already freckled like I've been laying out all summer and yes I've applied sunscreen every day before I step out the door.

"Here's a tip: don't compare audience size&amp;reactions and whether one group ""got"" the show on social media where audience members can see."
I have Liar Liar on DVD but inexplicably it only plays in French so I'm happy it's on tv tonight. My French isn't what it used to be.
Sometimes I want to take a road trip&amp;collect my thoughts&amp;decide where to go next in life. Then I'm like nah I'm afraid to leave my house.
"If you're in the NOVA area go see the @SPlaymakers Noises Off. Fantastic show, great set, fabulous cast and crew."
Life is too short to be around people you can't stand if you don't have to be around them. You don't owe anyone small talk.
"Yes, I know I smell like sunscreen. I had to walk to the car. I'm a redhead and it's sunny."
Just because something worked for you doesn't mean it will work for everyone. It's not one size fits all.
If I'm wearing a white shirt in spring or summer it's because I'm hoping it'll make my freckles look like they merged into a tan.#yayredhair

"If you feel the need to constantly assure someone you're a good,nice,trustworthy person, then you probably aren't."
"I would hope that anyone who knows me would feel they could talk to me about their experience,survivor to survivor.there r people who care."
I wonder how many other survivors feel they can't share their stories&amp;try to spread awareness but feel silenced for any reason.
I have a sleepy diaper dog. http://t.co/5EgBEN45xj
"And to anyone who supports survivors or spreads awareness,thank you for giving survivors an outlet and a way to be heard."
Most importantly bear in mind it doesn't matter what u think of what happened to them.their experiences and feelings are valid.
"If they trust you enough to open up to you,do not misuse that trust.It's hard enough for survivors to feel like they can talk about it."
"So if somebody discloses to you that they were abused,listen to them.Don't act as an investigator. Do not tell them they should be over it"
It is important for victims of sexual abuse to be heard and feel like they have a right to their feelings no matter what happened or when.

@JazzyGrape @kieranwood4 @VeganRevoIution there's no brain test for having depression that I am aware of but I was diagnosed
@JazzyGrape @kieranwood4 @VeganRevoIution it's caused by a variety of factors. Lifestyle and diet are some factors.
@JazzyGrape @kieranwood4 @VeganRevoIution actually no one is sure where depression comes from. Serotonin thing is just a theory I think.

@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution I kno plenty of people who love animals and still eat them.theres a better way though.morals aligning w/beliefs
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution cognitive dissonance.We're conditioned to love certain animals as pets and certain are food.its diff everywhere
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution if u care more about cows than people I want you to know you don't have to eat them.That's moral schizophrenia
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution see you still have compassion left! You don't need to eat animals to survive :) let them keep their sparkle
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution eating meat is still killing the animal that wanted to live a full life like you and I
"@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution if the end game is that the dairy cows still die when they're of no use to you, PETA has nothing to do w/this"
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution I believe you dont see abuse the same way I do.you might think the cows are happy?but think about if it was you
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution for veal. Milked til they can't anymore and are useless. Confined
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution so did the cows tell you themselves they want to be artificially inseminated. Birth calves to be taken away
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution you kill things you love? The family pet? Your little sister? You can't love someone and then kill them
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution and what is actually disgusting is the abuse torture and killing of animals.
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution its not saying oh anyone w an eating disorder is a bad person. Showing you that they don't need to abuse back
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution no. People can overcome eating disorders without eating meat (abusing animals)
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution you can defend a human abuse victim while still believing they shouldn'tbe abusing animals.actually makes sense
@Laiqalasse @VeganRevoIution then you might relate to the animals being abused a little more one would think. I speak up for those who can't

@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd I haven't but I've been diagnosed with clinical depression
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd it's super hard sometimes though
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso yes. Dwelling on the positive is much more fun
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd haha. I'd have to do some more research. I'm gonna be a history major next semester so this is like porn to me
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd it was only like three generations ago so at pretty recentish
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd idk but y'know. It makes sense.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd yeah well that's why my mom's side doesn't drink.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd that's all I know but when I found out I was like wow I come from class.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd uh well. Because my great grandpa's dad made moonshine during Prohibition and they wanted to get away from that
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso funny story it's why my maternal grandma's dad's family relocated from AL to AR
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd though tbh I'm descended from illegal moonshine makers so I dunno how I ended up being such a lightweight
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso I have Irish in me but not enough apparently.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso oh god an entire bottle would knock me out cold.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso probably don't wanna know.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd hangover was not worth it man. Never drank since.
"@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd yeah. I once went to a fancy restaurant, barely drank a thing. My friend had to steady me back to the car."
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd I can get tipsy after a sip of white wine. So yeah. I am.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd I've never actually experienced whiskey.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso I have a kerig or however you spell it
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd eh well I made it a few hours ago. It was too hot for hot coffee earlier.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso this coffee is actually making me sleepy.
"@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd besides the reign of Michael Ann, kitchen Nazi is almost over. Thankfully."
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd well I have coffee it'll have to replace alcohol.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd no. My family celebrates it on Christmas Eve because my dad works on Christmas
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso this conversation has happened at least three times today.
"@GenevieveVerso ""Paige you aren't doing this right"" ""then why don't YOU do it Michael Ann?"" ""I'm helping mom with dinner"" Helllllp"

We shouldn't be treated like this especially since we were just doing our jobs.
I am so stressed out now for me and my coworker's mental well being. Seriously. In the 4 years I've known her I've never seen her cry.
I am *so* sick of being perceived as not doing anything when I do everything I'm told and more. It drives me insane.
"I mean it's not like I made three lists, restocked the entire candy section and dusted the entire store. Pshh."
BUT since we made her wait thirty minutes for our pizza I apparently did NOTHING for the past few days except sit on my ass.
and seriously I tried my hardest to have everything done on her damn list by the time she got there. And it was to an extent.
BUT. Apparently since we made her wait thirty minutes to get our pizza that was all invalidated. We didn't do anything. Allegedly.
We ended up making about $300 in thirty minutes and that was pretty cool.
I mean EVERYONE decided to come in at that time and people were super needy and we were doing the best we could tbh.
She was supposed to pick up pizza and we were supposed to order it but we got slammed and there was no way for us to get to the phones.
Anyway. My boss made my coworker cry and me pissed beyond belief.
ughh...yeah shit just hit the fan.

this drives me insane. Seriously.
"The cafeteria ALSO charges extra for low transactions. We do not, hence the limit. We would make no money off a $1.75 purchase on a card."
The cafeteria jacked up their prices. We did not. They can do whatever they want since they raised to mirror the bank fees.
I will explain. We would not make any money off a low transaction because the bank fees are too damn high.
"so when I say ""We're not the cafeteria. I can't put $1.75 on your card"""" do NOT give me the bitchface."
@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos nah nevermind. I deleted it. my feed is lying to me.
why do people think we're gonna follow the rules of the hospital cafeteria? They're not state run. We are We still enforce the $3 card limit

@azarkansero @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso @Tauri3l you put mouth instead of south
@liz_smith333 @azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso @Tauri3l I was referring to the epic autocorrect mistake made by Megan
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @Tauri3l [sorry I had to]
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @Tauri3l THATS WHAT SHE SAID
"@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @Tauri3l it's hard having a Midwestern accent in the south, man."
"@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @Tauri3l I have trouble saying ""Asiago"""
FINALLY got Valentine's companion perk. Welp. Time to stop playing for today.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @Tauri3l actually northwest Louisiana but AR sounded less dignified.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @Tauri3l oh that too. I was thinking of the south Arkansas dialect
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @Tauri3l here in the south we call them spuds. Because we can't say potato
@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @liz_smith333 @GenevieveVerso @Tauri3l like I said last night babies don't know how to people yet.
@NoahClue it's quite adorable they snuggle and everything. It's the other cats she has problems with.
@NoahClue actually she did have a twin but I couldn't get her. And FYI the puppy looooves her.
Kisses! https://t.co/y2oYUhVCiH
She's still cute as a button though. https://t.co/vO4FIAwMzR
Princess Tali has tummy problems. :(((
It's late night weird documentary searching time! Yay!
@GenevieveVerso @Tauri3l @MissLusyd @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos night night.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @Tauri3l @liz_smith333 I think it's my best work. https://t.co/BwYOHFi3W4
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @Tauri3l @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos omg one sec
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @Tauri3l @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos can I send him badly drawn pictures of boobs instead?
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @Tauri3l @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos I DONT.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @Tauri3l @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos poor guy.
@Tauri3l @MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos I'm sure modifications are available
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @nothingalarming @TheFuxedos I have an album saved on Spotify but i have yet to listen to it. Next delivery run.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @nothingalarming @TheFuxedos what did they ever do to you!?
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @nothingalarming @TheFuxedos you must! For the kittens.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @nothingalarming @TheFuxedos LEAVE THE KITTENS OUT OF THIS https://t.co/fg2BrX02Oo
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @nothingalarming @TheFuxedos bit of both really.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @nothingalarming @TheFuxedos stayed for the weird ass conversations.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @nothingalarming @TheFuxedos I'm just here for the lols.
"@MissLusyd @nothingalarming @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso yeah the mayor doesn't need his ego stroked too much. He gets ""ideas"""
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l ..did I say something wrong?
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l dude I'm just upset because it would've made a great story
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l Bethesda is kink shaming me.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l WHY WONT NICK LOVE ME
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l tbh he was my second choice. My first choice was unavailable *sobs*
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l I'd do* damn phone.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l is so it with you I I knew the terms.
@liz_smith333 @GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l he comes and goes. It's a thing.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l also the different communities and gangs also have a different set of morals
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l also the different communities and gangs also have a different set of morals
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l dude I've been thinking about this while I play.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l I could actually use fallout as an example with factions and such.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l different societies have different concepts of right and wrong.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l well of course. A moral compass is constructed by society.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l but still!
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l it could go both ways. Babies don't know how to people yet.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l she took it to the place where it needed to go. GENIUS.
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l holy shit you're right
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l anyway have we fully defined twat nugget yet?
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l not to mention an entire wall of pens.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l we have a wide selection of chocolate and energy bars.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l dude it is. Our candy section is ridiculously massive and it takes all day.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l I should be shelving books not act as a living vending machine.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l restocking candy is mine. I work in a med school bookstore.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l oh you poor girl. I'm actually pretty lucky as far as retail jobs go tbh.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l sales and clearance racks are my own personal brand of hell.
"@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l I work retail, I'm well aware there is no escape."
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l those who put their money on the counter and leave...
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l I always stayed home where ya safe from the twat nuggets
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l thank god I work for the state and my store never has to do Black Friday.
@liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l @GenevieveVerso you started this oh great leader
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l aka what should be common sense but isn't.
"@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l nah, since it's a philosophy by a religion. We don't worship the twat nugget"
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @Tauri3l a good number of my customers are twat nuggets.
@GenevieveVerso @liz_smith333 @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l I might adhere to the twat nugget philosophy. It sounds very wise.
It's so rare that all four of us are here upstairs. Tali has so many people to smell during the movie.
"@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l Plato, Betham, Mills. Got it."
Finally convinced dad that we only needed to watch the original trilogy. Success.
@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l I've never actually studied it. I probably will eventually. Sounds like my kinda thing.
Nick Valentine better get max approval after this damn quest. I DESERVE IT
Running backwards and shooting aimlessly is a strategy I use waaaay too often.
@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @Tauri3l I may not know anything about the subject but damn I'll try to contribute.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos do I really want to answer that?
@MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso only way accepted.
"@MissLusyd @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso sometimes you gotta go deep, man."
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos Welp. I'm powerless.
@GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos @MissLusyd which I don't. They tried that a few years back didn't stick.
@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso ahhhh if only it were that simple.
@TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso actually completely impossible to be honest.
@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso eh. It honestly is what we make of it. My beliefs are kinda hard to summarize.
@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos @GenevieveVerso Same actually. Twitter is not made for theological discussions
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos wait I do. So God's will is chair fights?
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos ...I legit do not know how to respond to that.
@GenevieveVerso @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos so classy because divine beings can do whatever they want? Pshh
@MissLusyd @GenevieveVerso @TheFuxedos cmon now surely it'd be classier than that. Surely.
@MissLusyd @TheFuxedos I know. I work in retail. I KNOW.
@GenevieveVerso if I were truly bright I wouldn't have gotten so lost in this stupid game just now.
@TheFuxedos another one? I thought that event was last thanksgiving.
@GenevieveVerso oh pshh. Not really.
@GenevieveVerso yeah once I get one of those fancy Masters degrees I can move out. Only just got an associates so it'll be awhile.
@GenevieveVerso I say I'm independent while living rent free at my parents house so eh?
@GenevieveVerso what can I say I'm an independent woman?
@GenevieveVerso eh. I'll just try to get one of those degree things and see if I can get one of those job things
@GenevieveVerso yeah. I'm fresh out of those.
@GenevieveVerso I dot actually get too much attention. Mostly because I don't go anywhere.
@GenevieveVerso yeah the big blue doe eyes don't exactly help with scariness.
@GenevieveVerso yeah. We seem to be in the same boat. I'm actually 5'2 and look barely legal so if you actually have an arsenal can we share
@GenevieveVerso scary guy friends are a must while out in public
@GenevieveVerso aaaaand this is why I don't interact with people outside the Internet.
@MissLusyd not too much a pie person. Or a tea person. I have very plain tastes.
@MissLusyd is it sweet and delicious?
@MissLusyd I don't drink but that looks amazing.
@GenevieveVerso daw thanks. ~&lt;3
@GenevieveVerso personally I think I look like I'm 12 but y'know.
@GenevieveVerso eh. Like I said I'm mostly doing this for my health.
@GenevieveVerso I'm not. I'm jus really really short and 170 may not be a lot to some people but I SHOULD be 125
@GenevieveVerso dude I'm not one of them. I've never broken a bone in my life.
@GenevieveVerso actually there's a legit reason: I broke my toe last year by standing on it. My bones can't handle being this heavy.
@GenevieveVerso but I COULD have a perfect ass and be even cuter.
@GenevieveVerso it's the booty. I need to get rid of it. https://t.co/8mEQ2ePgKk
"@GenevieveVerso that's sweet but I am on the chubby side and my body needs to be thinner to be healthy. Delicate bones, y'see."
@ProfessorOtaku too pure...too precious for this world.
@ProfessorOtaku ...look I am well aware that I am tiny and chubby but I can have dreams.
@ProfessorOtaku DO YOU NOT BELIEVE ME
One of these days I will do enough sit ups to have abs of steel. *sigh* why is exercising so haaaaaaard
No snuggles until princess Tali has filled her quota of kitty fetch. No sleeping either unless you want your face licked
Princess Tali DEMANDS to play kitty fetch. Or else she will make sad crying noises.
@PikaHikariKT they're all in my bed somewhere.
Tali keeps stealing my hair ties for kitty fetch to the point where I have none because she has lost most of them.
No it doesn't matter what you're doing or what time it is. You will play Kitty fetch when Kitty wants to play Kitty fetch.
@Tauri3l @MissLusyd @azarkansero blech
@MissLusyd not to mention most likely fatal. HEYO.
@MissLusyd oh god. I dunno. Can we really top car fucking?
@MissLusyd good! Now we can move on to something more fun!
@MissLusyd just remember not everyone sucks. I know it's hard. Especially since I've cut myself off from actual people
@MissLusyd I don't *actually* follow my own advice though.
@MissLusyd am I sounding preachy? I just like helping people.
@MissLusyd you should carry yourself in a way as such. Like you shouldn't change anything except how you think about yourself.
"@MissLusyd well the way I see it, if you *think* everyone thinks that, there's a possibility they do. Fuck them. You ARE a person and-"
@MissLusyd it could be. Personally I think it looks awesome but different is treated differently by the public
@MissLusyd I hate people sometimes.
@Tauri3l @MissLusyd tear him to pieces. Then screenshot it and show us.
"@MissLusyd seriously? If you don't mind me asking, why?"
@MissLusyd we all have our coping mechanisms. And I think no human being should treat another like shit but eh? life happens.
@MissLusyd I bet. Destroying men's concept of existence sounds so badass tbh.
"@MissLusyd ahh yes. I wasn't too good at messing with them, my trolling techniques are too uncreative. I'm sure you're a master at it."
@MissLusyd yeah after the 50thish one I was bored. It's like the same guy was messaging me from different accounts
"@MissLusyd I always got the ""lonely gamer"" types."
@MissLusyd mine was too at first but it stopped being funny after a few months so I stopped.
@MissLusyd see that's why I left those sites years ago. I am a weird creepy guy magnet as well.
@MissLusyd oh god. That's terrifying.
@LonerDreamer eh that and messing with mccready seem to be doing it for her
@LonerDreamer well she just got done with finals. I think she's exercising pent up rage. It's hard being an engineering major apparently
"@LonerDreamer she also ditches him frequently and ""accidentally"" shoots him. Yet she won't change companions for some reason"
@LonerDreamer also everytime he complains about her hoarding she changes his outfit and gives him all her junk.
@LonerDreamer yeah I vaguely remember him in fallout 3. It's been a few years but it's really recent for her. The memories are still fresh
@LonerDreamer @PikaHikariKT I shudder at the thought of if she finds one even more ridiculous looking.
@tskimoongoddess I'm too nice to do that. Such a shame.
@tskimoongoddess she's just incredibly tacky with looting and extorting caps. Also underleveled like 70% of the time.
"@PikaHikariKT also she does a lot of other stuff to him too. Push him off lifts, dress him in bright clothes, etc."
"@PikaHikariKT I should've taken a picture of the hat of shame, then."
I have no idea why she takes delight in torturing that poor man but it's amazing
"Also there's the fact that she makes MacCready wear the ""hat of shame"" for ""being a turd in Fallout 3"""
Y'know the really dumb decisions that you try not to make in games? She makes all of them because why not
I think watching my sister play fallout 4 might be just as fun as playing it if not more.
Sleepy kitty. https://t.co/vcT9xphXiN
@LonerDreamer wellllll actually you can't change his clothes until his exile apparently. danse'
@LonerDreamer I will definitely take pictures.
my sister says she's gonna dress everyone like that.  https://t.co/tlv5GfV9nY
there are tears. his legs look lovely. https://t.co/cjmBtCRb9P
@GenevieveVerso @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos wow. Such class.
@GenevieveVerso @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos what does he think about Hancock's sparkling personality?
@GenevieveVerso @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos that's terrible! Why would he do such a thing?
@GenevieveVerso @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos actually she hasn't gotten there yet.
@GenevieveVerso @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos this is what she's wearing https://t.co/BOaicgBf51
@GenevieveVerso @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos was let off early. I'm watching my sister fail @ fallout
WHY DOESNT SHE EVER SNUGGLE WITH ME LIKE THIS https://t.co/csaqCX2dgM
@GenevieveVerso @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos ugh. No.
This is Tallahassee. https://t.co/S4eDrDlKRH
@BattleMonkeyz sounds like a party
@atmora too tired
@BattleMonkeyz ugh you have no idea how dead it was.
@BattleMonkeyz my boss told me to take a nap for her. I@might actually do that.
@BattleMonkeyz actually my boss let me go home.
At long last hell has released me.
@LacTheWatcher that ain't a diploma. that's a diploma /frame/
I am in hellllllllll https://t.co/WwVBBhtIy8
@azarkansero @Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos I'm like 60% sure I'm leaving early again. It's noon and no one is here.
@Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos we have one guy in the store rn. One guy.
@Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos you too? We're having a sale and it's failing miserably
@Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos please keep them rolling it's the only thing keeping me awake right now.
@MissLusyd @Shardfox @theWitchElf @azarkansero @TheFuxedos ugh I'd join in but I'm multitasking.
@MissLusyd @Shardfox @theWitchElf @azarkansero @TheFuxedos ...have I told you that I love you already? Because I do.
@MissLusyd @Shardfox @theWitchElf @azarkansero @TheFuxedos how long are we gonna keep the car thing up?
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @theWitchElf @Shardfox @TheFuxedos we are pretty hot aren't we?
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @theWitchElf @Shardfox @TheFuxedos I would marry us.
I may be falling asleep. https://t.co/3YtZwdHmZw
@MissLusyd @Shardfox @theWitchElf @azarkansero @TheFuxedos oooof course you did.
@BattleMonkeyz a medical school bookstore run by the state.
@BattleMonkeyz a medical school bookstore run by the state.
@MissLusyd @Shardfox @theWitchElf @azarkansero @TheFuxedos ...where..HOW did you find that?
@BattleMonkeyz eh we had a good sale last week so eh?
"""I'm running away and never coming back"" ""Ok. I'm burning down the store, is that okay?"" ""Pshh I get paid regardless, so sure"""
@Shardfox @theWitchElf @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos that screenshot says it all. Beautiful.
@theWitchElf @MissLusyd @Shardfox @azarkansero @TheFuxedos it honestly looks like the car equivalent of a tricycle
@theWitchElf @MissLusyd @Shardfox @azarkansero @TheFuxedos look I didn't even know~loving~ cars was possible til last night.
@theWitchElf @Shardfox @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos omaigawd that's awesome.
"I told my boss it MIGHT be the worst sale ever and she's like ""whaddya mean MIGHT be. If I fall asleep, you can hit me"""
ohmaigawd this is the worst sale in the history of sales.
@theWitchElf @Shardfox @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos i honestly don't know what that is.
"@MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos I'm just sorry I missed the really great/terrible ones. Ah, well. I had to sleep."
Sooooo...the sale is a complete failure.
RT @michaelianblack: People online are so much more cautious about revealing movie spoilers than they are about calling each other racial e…
RT @LOLGOP: Trump basically wants to be the president of Russia.
RT @UncleYo: This is the first time in history that Star Wars and Christmas have been said together without collective groaning.
I feel oodles better. Still not 100% but some recovery is better than no recovery.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos I wake up to a bunch of car puns. You guys are great.
Back to bed. Night folks.
@MissLusyd sorry. I'm on a diet and my mother is being my enforcer. *sigh*
@MissLusyd oh yeah. That too.
Awwww my kitty wants in. Guess my parents don't give enough belly rubs.
"@MissLusyd my mother would take one look at that and be like ""that's too many calories why are you drinking that?"""
"@MissLusyd """"""""""""""""""""""healthy"""""""""""""""""""""
@MissLusyd @Tory_B_Martin @azarkansero seriously I'll probably be back in an hour. My insomnia is predictable
@MissLusyd @Tory_B_Martin @azarkansero and with that. I should go to bed. I'll probably be awake in a couple of hours. It happens.
@MissLusyd @Tory_B_Martin @azarkansero @TheFuxedos I should be sorry. I'm not. This was a great way to spend a Thursday night.
@Tory_B_Martin @MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos that was the plan actually
@MissLusyd @azarkansero yup. Guess I'm staying up.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero actually not the weirdest thing I've heard of after the car conversation
@MissLusyd @azarkansero I should go to bed but I probably won't.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero weird-er I suppose
@azarkansero @MissLusyd THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO BE KNOWN FOR
@MissLusyd @azarkansero I got one too https://t.co/NSrvYtLtno
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos fine. I'd fuck a Lexus.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos I am a CHILLLD
@azarkansero @MissLusyd @TheFuxedos I am TOO PURE to disclose this information
"@MissLusyd @azarkansero or...""Sinnin' wagon""? :D"
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @TheFuxedos this might be the strangest conversation of my 24 1/2 years of life
"@MissLusyd @azarkansero ""Danny if you could fuck a car, what would you fuck?"""
@MissLusyd @azarkansero ...actually The pure thing is mostly an act. Mostly.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero TOOO PURE I AM.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd that is a door we should leave locked.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero NO. I AM TOO PURE TO SEE IT
@MissLusyd @azarkansero I'm surprised there isn't actual footage of this. Guys really do love their cars. No. I don't want to actually see
@MissLusyd @azarkansero what if the Volkswagen doesn't get his motor running?
@MissLusyd @azarkansero well I assume he's dead.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd oh god what is wrong with us the tears are back
@MissLusyd @azarkansero yeah but I mean fatally exploding.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd yup. I can see it.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero MAYBE HE LIKES THE DANGER OF STICKING HIS DICK IN SOMETHING THAT MIGHT EXPLODE
@MissLusyd @azarkansero unless the condom is also metal with some sort of insulation coating
@MissLusyd @azarkansero oh god I'm crying
@MissLusyd @azarkansero wouldn't that like...I dunno..burn a dick off?
@MissLusyd @azarkansero wait. Is the car on during the banging?
@azarkansero @MissLusyd I started at exhaust and then my brain died.
"@MissLusyd @azarkansero I dunno if we can top ""burnin' rubber"""
@MissLusyd @azarkansero you are REALLY good at this
@azarkansero @MissLusyd for my own personal amusement you should do this
@azarkansero @MissLusyd oh my god. Block that boy asap
@azarkansero @MissLusyd wait. What. This is why I don't do facebook
@MissLusyd @azarkansero I can't taste food atm so everything is meh
@MissLusyd @azarkansero nah it's a whole conversion process. I assume. I dunno.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd nope. That is a public service. The opposite of sin.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd yes. I am a sinnamon roll without the sin.
@azarkansero @MissLusyd I'm too pure and innocent to generate sin so idk
@azarkansero WHY CANT YOU TUNE TO C LIKE A NORMAL PERSON
@azarkansero @MissLusyd I AM SO BORED GUYS
@azarkansero like the whole b flat thing? A transposing nightmare.
"@azarkansero yeaaaaaah I am the worst brass player in the history of brass players. Thing is, you guys are tuned differently and it THROWSME"
@azarkansero string instruments are a series of half and whole steps. If you know the string names you're halfway there.
@azarkansero otherwise it seems braggy
"@azarkansero thing is, it's very misleading. I feel the need to explain that if you know one string instrument you know most of them."
@azarkansero I can't stress enough how mediocre I am music wise.
@azarkansero like I said. Not really impressive.
@azarkansero I was a music Ed major like four years ago. That's why. Also I have a mezzo soprano vocal range.
"@azarkansero a mandolin is a violin with frets. I also play guitar, piano, and I've been instructed in trumpet and baritone"
"@azarkansero Violin, viola, cello, and bass. All part of the same family"
@azarkansero it's a lot less impressive than it sounds. Seriously.
@azarkansero I used to doodle but I got in trouble for it.
"@azarkansero can't write, never trained properly to draw. I'm a mediocre musician who can barely play 9 instruments. Can't contribute much."
@MissLusyd ah. I dislike the taste of alcohol so I never drink.
@azarkansero eh. She kinda blended in the background to me.
@azarkansero I found a one shot that explored it and I wanted it to be longer. It's a shame I can't write.
"@MissLusyd don't get too hammered, mmkay?"
"@azarkansero ah, Tumblr. Well, I dot see too much about piper but I see a LOT of Hancock"
@azarkansero also it's possible the SS met Prewar Nick since she was a lawyer
@azarkansero I reallyreally wanted to romance Nick though. It fits. He's out of time...she's out of time.
@azarkansero Tbh I WAS gonna romance Macready but Hancock won me over
@azarkansero ughhhh I was so mad
@azarkansero *boring
@azarkansero Hancock is second and I'll use Deacon and Piper a lot. Macready complains too much and the others are prong
@azarkansero Nick. Nick is the best. Hands down. I'm only romancing Hancock because Nick is unavailable.
@BattleMonkeyz yeah there's only three of us and 2 registers.
@azarkansero she's so funny.
"@azarkansero I'm actually a pretty silent player. I'll yell at companions and talk to the screen but my sister should stream, tbh."
@BattleMonkeyz yes less shit is good. Hopefully I'm not running the sale solo like last week.
@azarkansero it was less badass because a) she's wearing the outfit with yellow shorts and b) she screams a lot
@MissLusyd ...having fun? :D
"@BattleMonkeyz had to go home early because I felt like shit. I rested, still feel like shit but less shit."
@BattleMonkeyz trying to get healthy before the big sale tomorrow.
@Arcadyagami I CANT STOP PLAYING. There's so much todo.
"@azarkansero she's level 5, has no ammo and armed with a machete."
@azarkansero I'm jealous. I was watching my sister play for awhile which was probably the funniest thing I've seen in awhile.
"So since I have been cut off from Fallout 4, I have nothing to do. What's up guys?"
"I don't think I can sit through Hayden Christensen's acting ever again. I'm sorry, father."
"But my dad INSISTS we watch the prequels because ""we must prepare""."
Of course I'll join once they start the original.
"So my sister is home and my dad has roped her into watching all six Star Wars movies. In ""chronological"" order. Hahahahahaha"

@MissLusyd The swamps of Northwest Louisiana has many many many things flying in the air.
"@MissLusyd yes you do seem knowledgeable in the subject. I don't usually, my main problem is seasonal allergies which Claritin fixes."
@MissLusyd I'm pretty sure it's dry sinus. I'm not sniffly at all.
"@MissLusyd Pshh. I work next to a hospital, I'm bound to get sick occasionally."
@MissLusyd dude as long as I don't have to drink it it's cool.
@MissLusyd I'll try it if I end up staying over lunch. It's pretty miserable.
@MissLusyd we do have those. Might do that if boss lady won't let me go home.
@MissLusyd haha well ironically I'm stuck at a medical school bookstore and we have none of that in our drug section.
@MissLusyd I have no idea. My throat hurts too. I think it's dry sinus or something since I feel pressure and junk.
I asked to go home but I never got a straight answer. Welp. Guess I'm staying here.
I'm not even sniffly. the top of my nose feels raw when I breathe through it and it's miserable.
My sinuses hate me.
My sinuses hate me.
It feels like I JUST left this god damn store.

@MissLusyd @azarkansero @tskimoongoddess @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos I ended up stealing that actually. It's a shame I can't wear it though.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @tskimoongoddess @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos I gave him a good verbal thrashing before Hancock finished him off.
@TheFuxedos @MissLusyd @tskimoongoddess @Tauri3l @azarkansero let's hope you still think that a week from now. Ghoulettes multiply.
@MissLusyd @azarkansero @tskimoongoddess @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos it was a beautiful shank you should've waited.
@MissLusyd @tskimoongoddess @Tauri3l @azarkansero @TheFuxedos he fed the ghoulettes. I'm sure he expected this.
I'd fall asleep again but something furry and adorable is trying to push me off the bed.
The thing about passing out at 9:30 is that you end up waking up again at 10:40...and again at like 1:30. Yay insomnia!
@azarkansero @Tauri3l @TheFuxedos @tskimoongoddess @MissLusyd I was asleep for all of that. Damn responsible adult sleep schedule.

we both have helped this..very indecisive lady pick out shirts previously and we both decided it was Mary Ann's turn.
my boss and I are terrible terrible people.
@MaraWritesStuff not unless they were trying to hit on you
@BattleMonkeyz also they were tiny.
"@BattleMonkeyz couple of years ago, me and my sister made a snow couple and they lasted a day."
@BattleMonkeyz if we ever do get snow there won't BE enough for a snowman. ;w;
@BattleMonkeyz *sobs* i just want winter sosososo bad.
@BattleMonkeyz I feel like I need a shower every time I step outside. it ain't pleasant.
@Megafighter3 I WAS JUST BEING FRIENDLY AND SHE GOT OFFENDED.
@Megafighter3 Like..we weren't even arguing about anything. I was just being silly and she thought I was being condescending.
"@BattleMonkeyz In the swamp, it's hot, humid, wet, and gross all year round.,"
@BattleMonkeyz yeah we're just now getting around to the hot side of fall.
@BattleMonkeyz hahaha it's 63 degrees outside. I'm still running the AC on full blast.
"@ProfessorOtaku yeah, that was our reaction as well. I can't wait to get out of retail."
@BattleMonkeyz it's too wet to run here. :(
"@ProfessorOtaku ""maybe..uh..you came off as condescending?"""
"@ProfessorOtaku ""wait...that's ALL you said? Really?"""
@ProfessorOtaku yeah she was kinda dumbfounded when I told her about it.
"My boss was like ""Eh.. I didn't see it as offensive but you kinda need to watch your tone sometimes"""
"@BattleMonkeyz Still getting fat. Hahaha. But yes, you're right."
Like.. she was truly offended.
Holy CRAP lady I was trying to be funny.
@BattleMonkeyz I make $8.87 an hour. It's not really a fortune.
"A customer asked me what ink was on sale. I said ""Ink? HP Ink!"" and she's like ""I know it's HP Ink I'm not STUPID"""
I was trying to be funny and friendly and it blew up in my face. Turns out I came off as condescending.
@BattleMonkeyz hahahah actually I'm doing pretty awful but thanks.
"Another day, another offended customer."
I wonder why certain groups are against this. Isn't it common sense? it's not like they're taking them away. https://t.co/x9rpJE546f
@BattleMonkeyz calvin yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
Too tired to play video games. Is this a part of this quarter life crisis I keep hearing about?
"""Do you have a...thing to go on *gestures to object* y'know..a thing?"" No. Because I have no idea what you're referring to."
i.e. I've already gotten into it with my boss this morning. *sigh*
Today I'm gonna make it be a good day even though it started off horribly. Wish me luck!
Also starting to get to the point in Fallout 4 where I have to search for doable side quests. Not that I'm complaining. Exploring is fun.

@ErinSmi14035528 I tend to switch every mission usually but I tend to use Hancock and Valentine the most. They don't judge me for hoarding
@ErinSmi14035528 dude I love Danse but only because  of the Buzz Lightyear memes.
"@ErinSmi14035528 God no. I'm never that bold, not  even on the Internet. Besides, I'm more of a Nick Valentine fangirl myself."
@ErinSmi14035528 @Tauri3l @fallenangel460 I think they're funny despite me being scared of them.
@ErinSmi14035528 @Tauri3l @fallenangel460 eh honestly I can only speak for myself. Not gonna lie though...some of the Ghoulettes scare me
"@ErinSmi14035528 @Tauri3l @fallenangel460 Please, I'm the least scary person ever."
@ErinSmi14035528 @TheFuxedos @fallenangel460 I'm more of a lurker than a participator but the Ghoulettes are a special kind of people.

"@ProfessorOtaku a) I have job security, I'm not gonna do that and b) she's only a terrible boss if she's in a mood."
Look lady. I am TRYING to stay busy. You're not helping.
"Example: you're trying to stay busy and she says ""Oh, you're STILL not done with that?"""
What's the least offensive way to ask your boss to stop being condescending?
"@Megafighter3 Oh, I've been feeling it for years, man."
I may be in the least festive spirit in my entire life. Damn you retail.
Lovely. My boss is on a power trip this morning.
@TheFuxedos @godofsideburns I can totally do that. Just gimme a voice modulator and I can do my Ash Ketchum voice.
*sigh* My cat is a binge eater.
@TheFuxedos @godofsideburns hm. I'll mull over it and get back to you on that. It's a tempting offer.
"@TheFuxedos @godofsideburns I'm in need of some extra experience, is this a paid internship?"
and I don't know why. Is it the bouncing animation? Except I get the same effect in first pov as well.
I should clarify: watching my character in power armor makes me nautious.
Does wearing power armor in fallout 4 give anyone else motion sickness or is it just me?

It's not really a big thing for me since I'm going to another school next semester.
