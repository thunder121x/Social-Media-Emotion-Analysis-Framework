@madreeve you're a huge challenge.
@madreeve his parents got a divorce shortly after. I lost contact with the rest.
"Chances are, if there's symptoms of it, you could treat it earlier before it spirals into something uncontrollable. Trust in modern medicine"
"If you see/somehow feel like your children are acting weirdly, please please please seek help. Jangan lah in-denial."
"I told her many times that the kid's not behaving normally. Like he has some form of autism

Even if he doesn't, wouldn't checking be better"
You know what's frustrating? My cousin (his makcik) refusing to accept the fact that the kid should be sent to a doctor for checkup.
"And he took a toy and threw it at the window, smashing it, all because the other kids were ""noisy""

Like. Tf."
"Then kindergarten when he was 5. His parents were called by the school because during playtime, the other kids were playing around"
eg. You call his name and he'd look at you for a split second then look away. Idk. He just seemed to be behaving weirdly for a 4 y/o.
And then he doesn't really throw tantrums? He just likes to do his own thing. He doesn't respond to affection. Nor to attention.
"Whenever people talk, he would cover his ears and then scream ""DIAM. DIAM. BISING"" like. We weren't even shouting or anything."
I have a cousin who's autistic. At least. I think he was autistic. He was 4. But he showed signs of having autism.

@SW1128 I think ASB is the cheapest broker and it's a minimum $30 per trade. Smart shares you pay a percentage of your investment no minimum
@SW1128 but the smart money is always on index funds. A Random Walk Down Wall Street is a good book to read
@SW1128 low as costs due to the fact they're all index funds. Minimum $500 buy in. Minimum $50 regular contribution
@SW1128 and yea smart shares is the shit. If you're wanting to get into individual stock picking though it's not suitable
@SW1128 a few rules of thumb are typically all you need
@SW1128 asset allocation would all depend on your own goals and I've never personally read anything touching on this topic.
